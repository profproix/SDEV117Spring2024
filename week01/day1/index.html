            <h4>Bio:</h4>
            <p> Rose was surrendered to PAWs at the early age of 1 year and stayed there for 5 years until he was adopted by his current owner. He is a sweet 13-year-old indoor cat with the energy of a kitten. While not a traditionally trained Software Developer, Rose excels at full-stack development. He's always willing to perform a code review and give honest, actionable feedback. Sadly, his feedback is typically ignored as he is a Cat, and no one can understand what he's saying.
