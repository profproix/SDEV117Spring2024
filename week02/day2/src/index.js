//Functions 
// Functions are containers for code that have a specific task.
// Most of your programming will be contained in functions
// Why?
// They allow our code to be organized and reusable!
//  We follow the DRY Principle "Don't Repeat Yourself"
// Don't reinvent the wheel

// Printing a function 

// Calling a function 


// Outputs  
// returns also provide the output of a function.
// If the return is blank or missing, the function will return undefined


//Functions can not have multiple returns in the same block or area between { ... }
//The first return will end this function before we get to the second

//Inputs 
// Functions can take inputs
// when we define them, they are called parameters
// parameters are variables defined in the function definition 
// that represents the input of the function.  

// When we pass values to a function it's called an argument

//Conditional Statement
// A Statement is an instruction 
// let a = 1; is a statement, the instruction is assigned 1 to a variable called a
// Conditional statements handle some logic.
// If there is milk, get 12


//Stretch 
// Calling methods
// Methods and functions are containers for code that has a specific task
// Most things in JavaScript have built-in Methods. 
// Methods are functions built under the hood that do specific things
// They are normally called with dot notation and invoked with ()
// "Hullaballoo".charAt(6) -> will tell us what character is at index 6


// Strings **************************************************

// String length 

// .charAt(index) returns the character at an index
console.log("Hullaballoo".charAt(6))
